# Active Vibration Control on STM32 (AVCSTM32)

Project on STM32H7A3 microcontroller for active vibration reduction. 

### Tech

AVCSTM32 uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [CMSIS v5] - Hardware abstraction layer for microcontrollers that are based on Arm® Cortex® processors
* [FreeRTOS] - Real-time operating system for microcontrollers
* [ETL] - Embedded Template Library
